        Firewatch is a mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness, where your only
        emotional lifeline is the person on the other end of a handheld radio.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The year is 1989, and there is to be alot of activity.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work
        as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a mountain,
        it's your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a
        woman named Delilah, is available to you at all times over a small,
        handheld radio—and is your only contact with the world you've left
        behind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into
        the world below, you'll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing
        questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or destroy the
        only meaningful relationship you have.
